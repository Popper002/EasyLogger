**EasyLogger** is a simple and lightweight logging utility written in C.  
It is designed for easy integration into your projects and provides functionality for logging messages with different severity levels, precise timestamps (including milliseconds), and process IDs.

---

## üîß Features

- **Log Levels**: Supports multiple log levels such as `DEBUG`, `TRACE`, `APPERRO`, and `SYSERRO`.
- **Timestamps**: Logs include precise timestamps with millisecond accuracy.
- **Process Information**: Each log includes the process ID (PID) for better traceability.
- **File Logging**: Logs are written to a specified file in append mode, preserving previous entries.
- **System Logging**: Optionally logs messages to the system log using `syslog` (Linux only).
